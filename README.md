# Reinforcement_Learning

This repository explores the exciting field of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning approach where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. In RL, the agent makes decisions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adapts its behavior to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

Key Concepts

* Agent-Environment Interaction: The core of RL involves the agent interacting with an environment, learning optimal strategies through trial and error.
* Reward Optimization: The agent seeks to maximize cumulative rewards, adjusting its decision-making process to achieve better outcomes.
* Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing exploration of new strategies and exploitation of known ones is crucial for effective learning.
